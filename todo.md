# Todo
- in `readme.md` explain reason for architecture
- in `analyze_music.md` describe data structure of `music.js`
- in `analyze_music.py` suppress deprecation warnings
- in `analyze_music.py` handling for missing id3 tags with warnings 
- in `index.html`/`scripts.js` add loading screen (because music.js can get big)
- starting another track should close details from previous one
- fix flawed media session fu
- play/pause status update not working on initial page load and when using media session play/pause/prev/next buttons from notifications drawer or lock screen

# Maybe later
- in `analyze_music.py` better date handling
- in `analyze_music.py` if there is no embedded cover, look for a jpg/png/gif/webp file
- in `index.html`/`scripts.js` add shortcut hints & theme switcher
- handling & layout for no cover art
