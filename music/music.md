Drop m4a files in this folder. 

The file names should have the following structure to be listed in chronologic order:
```
YYYY.MM.DD - Artist - Title.m4a
```

They must contain the following id3 tags:
- Artist
- Title (YYYY.MM.DD)
- Genre
- Tracklist in Comment
- Cover Art

Since the date field usually only contains the year, the exact date must be entered with the year, month, and day in parentheses at the end of the title.
